<h1>Introduction</h1>

This document contains information for developers working on the
jcmdline package. It is not too complete a document, but will be
added to as necessary. This project is hosted on <a href=
"http://sourceforge.net">SourceForge</a>. Any work on this project
should be done from a <a href=
"https://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=68688">CVS copy of the
source files</a>.

<h1>Running a Single UT</h1>

To run a single unit test, the "ant utone" target can be used. 
<p>Alternately, it is sometimes simpler to just run from the
command line and see the output. An environment file,
<strong><em>jcmdline.env</em></strong>, can be sourced into the
user's environment (might want to modify this to suit your
environment). A unit test may then be run from the command
line:</p>

<pre>
java jcmdline/StringParam_UT
</pre>

or even a single test within the UT: 
<pre>
java jcmdline/StringParam_UT testMaxLength
</pre>

A list of tests within a UT file can be obtained with the -help
option: 
<pre>
java jcmdline/StringParam_UT -help
</pre>

<h1>Releasing a New Version of jcmdline</h1>

<p>OTE: All instructions in this section subject to change as the
sourceforge site enhances and modifies its developer services.
Always reference the information on the SourceForge site for 
more current information</p>

<p>These are the current notes for releasing a new version of the
jcmdline package. At some point it would be nice to have ant do
more of this automatically, but since the process is still being
experimented with, I am leaving much of it manual. To release a new
version of the package: </p>
<ul>
<li>Up the release number in the build.xml file.</li>

<li>Document changes in the CHANGES file (this is easiest to do as
you go along).</li>

<li>Run "ant dist", which will clean, build, run all UTs to verify
all is well, and create distribution files.</li>

<li>Commit all code changes in CVS.</li>

<li>Tag the release: "cvs tag rel-1-0 ." from the jcmdline
directory.</li>

<li>FTP distribution files to sourceforge: 
<pre>
cd dist
[me]: ftp upload.sourceforge.net

</li>

<li>Use the admin forms on SourceForge (project <em>Admin</em>
page, select <em>Edit/Release Files</em>).  For the release name, use the
release number (i.e. 1.0.3...).  Upload the ./CHANGES file where requested;
click the "Keep my formatting" button.
</li>

<li>Update the SourceForge homepage by doing the following: 
<ul>
<li>Run "ant webpkg" to generate a gzipped tarfile of the homepage
and docs.</li>
<li>scp it to userspace on SourceForge: 
<pre>
cd build/tmp
scp homepage.tar.gz myUserName,jcmdline@shell.sourceforge.net:homepage.tar.gz
</pre>
</li>

<li>Log onto sourceforge shell server and unpack the file in the
webspace: 
<pre>
[local]: ssh myUserName,jcmdline@shell.sourceforge.net
[onSF]$ gunzip homepage.tar.gz
[onSF]$ cd /home/groups/j/jc/jcmdline/htdocs
[onSF]$ rm -rf *
[onSF]$ tar xf ~/homepage.tar
[onSF]$ cd
[onSF]$ rm homepage.tar
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>From email by Alexander Ivanyukovich (java foundry guide):
<p>
If   you  want  further  announces  to  appear  in  either
  Announces  or  News, submit them through "Suggest news" or
  "Submit news" link on the foundry page.

  It  will  be  really  good,  if  you can use the following
  structure(also, your announce will be approved faster):

  <pre>  &lt;URL where I can find your product logo, up to 100 x 100 px - optional&gt;
  &lt;short product description - 2-3 sentences&gt;
  &lt;product homepage link&gt;
  Changes:
  &lt;list of changes&gt;</pre>
</li>
</ul>
