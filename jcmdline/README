The jcmdline package is used to process command line parameters from
a Java program.

This directory contains the source necessary to build the jcmdline java
package.  It also contains a prebuilt jar file, jcmdline-<rel>.jar.  The 
jar file is all that is necessary to use this package - make sure
that it is placed somewhere in the CLASSPATH.

The javadoc API can be found under the doc directory.

A User Guide that provides information on effective use of this program
is accessible from the Description section of the package summary page
in the javadoc API.  (It is also available in the doc-files directory
in the package source directory).

The project builds with ant.  To obtain a copy of ant, go to 
http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/index.html.  Execute:

    ant -projecthelp

for a list of build targets.

Unit tests require JUnit, available from http://www.junit.org/index.htm.
