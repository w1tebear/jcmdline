/**
 * An Exception that indicates a command line processing error.
 * <P>
 * Sample Usage:
 * <P>
 * To use this for an exception in package 'mypackage', a properties file called
 * 'errors.properties' might be created in directory 'mypackage' with the
 * following properties:
 * 
 * <pre>
 *     # Contents of errors.properties file
 *     PercentTooLow: \
 *     Percent must be greater than {0}, got {1}.
 * 
 *     PercentTooHigh: \
 *     Percent must be less than {0}, got {1}.
 * </pre>
 * <P>
 * Throwing an exception would be done as in the following:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * if (percent &gt; 100) {
 * 	ResourceBundle rb = ResourceBundle.getBundle(&quot;mypackage.errors&quot;);
 * 	String msg = rb.getString(&quot;PercentTooHigh&quot;);
 * 	throw new CmdLineException(msg, new Object[] { new Integer(100),
 * 			new Integer(percent) });
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <P>
 * The package may now be modified to accomodate a French Locale by creating a
 * file 'errors_fr.properties' in directory 'mypackage' that contains all
 * messages in 'errors.properties', converted to French.
