Because some of the functionality of the jcmdline package involves 
classes whose function is to perform a task and exit the program, it
is not always possible to unit test them conveniently with junit.

There are files in this directory, SampleNN.java that can be used
to test functionality of various aspects of the package.  This has
to be done manually at this point - so sorry.
